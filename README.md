# Axion-CS2-RAGE-CHEAT
 + The source code of AXION CS2 internal rage cheat.
 + It's made on asphyxia base and has some features implemented from csgo cheats like Pandora.
 + I decided to make it public beacause it has been sold for 75$ and then leaked on the internet.
 + It has some great features but it can't be used for hvh because its preety buggy.
 + The cheat might get you VAC banned so only use it at your own risk (better on non prime accounts).

# Status: Needs update!
I don't have time to work on it anymore because of lack of time and other personal projects but I'll let it for the community.

If you are trying to fix it, you have to:
- Update the schema (take it from asphyxia because it's the same)
- Update the signatures (You can find them in hooks.cpp/hooks.h).
- Make sure you build it on publish and not on release. (If you build on release you will get a lot of errors)
- Make sure you include everything required in the project settings!

# TO-DO
 + Improve the rage tab and some miscellaneous features because they were created to manipulate the game server and they only work on local games/practice games. Basically on higher ping games, the rage is completely useless, as well as bhop which makes the character fly while holding space. All those bugs can be fixed if you know what to do.
